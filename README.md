# Currency Converter

A simple Currency Converter web application that fetches live exchange rates and allows users to convert between different currencies.

## Features

- Convert between a wide range of currencies.
- Displays real-time exchange rates.
- Beautiful UI with country flag support.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality, including fetching exchange rates and updating the UI dynamically.
- **Currency API**: Fetches live currency conversion rates from an external API.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvpatel777141/currency-converter.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Currency-Converter

3. Open index.html in your browser to use the Currency Converter application.


## How It Works

1. The user inputs an amount and selects the "From" and "To" currencies.
2. The app fetches the exchange rate for the selected currencies from an API.
3. The conversion result is displayed, and the country flags for the selected currencies are shown.
4. The exchange rate information is updated dynamically when the user changes the currencies or amount.


## Warning

- API Dependency: The Currency Converter relies on an external API for fetching exchange rates. If the API's structure or endpoint changes in the future, the application may not work as expected.
- In case the API changes, you might need to update the code to reflect the new API structure or endpoint.
